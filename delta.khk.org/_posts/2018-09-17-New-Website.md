### History
KHK Delta is notorious for re-creating our website. As a student organization, our turnover for webmasters is quite high! In the past we've used CMS solutions like Wordpress and Drupal. These systems are powerful yet heavy and complex. They require multiple moving parts such as Apache, Wordpress, themes, plugins, databases. This all becomes a hassle when the site needs to be moved or updates.

This all did come with a lot of admin-convenience such as editing posts in a browser. Fortunately our solution fits our membership; we're using Git! All of our files are human-readable right from within the repository. There are no databases. There's no Wordpress settings. Thanks to markdown and YAML, finding, editing, and publishing content is easy.

Ultimately, the all-in-one solutions of the past turned out to be too much hassle. Our content is now quickly readable and easy to update. Site updates are done with the familiar tool, Git. We're invulnerable to security attacks [common to CMS solutions](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-2337/product_id-4096/). Our site is *much faster* to load and works great on mobile.

Plus, we're a computer engineering fraternity, our site should be built by us!
