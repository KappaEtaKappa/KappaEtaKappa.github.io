Join us for our first Open House of the Spring 2020 semester! Starting at 6 pizza and drinks will be available. Come any time and stay as long as you want. It’ll be a great chance to see the house and meet the members.

Who doesn’t love pizza‽ Well, maybe not everybody. Don’t worry, we’ll have other food and drink available! If you can’t make the event make sure to [visit us at one of our other events]({{site.baseurl}}/events). ;)
