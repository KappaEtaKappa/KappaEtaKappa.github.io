          KHK was founded at the University of Wisconsin as an electrical engineering
          fraternity in 1924. Today many of our members also study computer engineering,
          computer science and other technical programs. Members often study and work
          together at our house.

          College can be a new and often stressful experience. It helps to have friends and family close. Members benefit from a fraternal relationship strengthened by tradition and legacy. Membership is also a great way to meet new, like-minded friends-of-friends.
